**TECHNOLOGY USED -**

* Flask

* React
* CSS 
* Postman

**GETTING STARTED -** 
We used extensive wireframeing to map out the models, routes, and the layout of the app. Then we listed features that would enhance the user experience and researched sites like SNKRS and GOAT before choosing our style direction.
